# Fashion-Apparel-Classification
**Image Classifier** (A Deep learning project that uses Convolution neural Network) VGG16 Architecture for classifying Apparel Images.It classifies the image into 9 different classes (Goggles,Hat,Jacket,Shirt,Shorts,T-shirt,Trouser,Wallet,Watch)


## Deep learning
**Deep learning** is a type of machine learning; a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that allows machines to learn from data.Deep learning involves the use of computer systems known as neural networks.

In neural networks,the input filters through hidden layers of nodes.These nodes each process the input and communicate their results to the next layer of nodes.This repeats untill it reaches an output layer,
and the machine provides its answers.

Deep learning allows machines to identify and extract features from images.This means they can learn the features to look for in images by analysing lots of pictures.
So,Programmer don't need to enter these filters by hand.
